**Brief:** This homework is based on **Goodreads**.

Goodreads is a social platform with  a data base which contains numerous book data,mostly for commercialized books.

[https://www.goodreads.com/](https://)  .

During implementation we learned :   

**1.]  How to preprocess text that is going to be used in Natural Language Processing.**

**2.]  Differences and directions of count and prediction models ( non context based ).**

**3.]  We also refreshed a bit our M.L.  past experience as a tool to demonstrate our work on the above.**


**NOTES :**
 *Before first execution in your personal Jupyter Notebook
try finding keyword "CONTROL3".*

 *In the following cell delete the "#" right after comment1 and comment2 .*

*Have in mind that ,configurations can be done fast by finding the keyword "CONTROL" .*
